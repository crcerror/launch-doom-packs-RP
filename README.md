# launch-doom-packs-RP

Some scripts to easy launch several WADs used by prBOOM within RetroPie
It is intended to backup your savegames by zipping those and create one archive for each doom-branch you play.
So you don't need to symlink the prBOOM.wad and store every orignal id game in it's own subfolder

Attention this method was only tested for libretro-prboom in RetroPie branch

# | Launch Doom, Doom2, Plutonia, TNT-Evilution and other WAD files      rel. 07/15/17 |
# | Prerequisites:                                                                     |
# | 1. PrBOOM working on your Pie                                                      |
# | 2. WAD files of doom, doom2, tnt...                                                |
# | 3. Working zip! If not type "sudo apt install zip"                                 |
# |                                                                                    |

# |                                                                                    |
# | Why:                                                                               |
# | I think it's better to have a collection of all doom files in one folder and you   |
# | don't not have to mess around with symlinking and copy of prboom.wad.              |
# | So this will automate save game working in the same destination folder via zipping |
# |                                                                                    |
# | How to:                                                                            |
# | In your base folder ~/RetroPie/roms/doom/ copy all your WAD files you want to run  |
# |                                                                                    |
# | Check settings in Synopsis!                                                        |
# | Check if path locations is correct                                                 |
# | Check if wadfile settings load correct edition!                                    |
# | Save variable is autogenerated by wadfilename, you can change if you don't like    |
# |                                                                                    |
