# launch-doom-packs-RP

Some scripts to easy launch several WADs used by prBOOM within RetroPie
It is intended to backup your savegames by zipping those and create one archive for each doom-branch you play.
So you don't need to symlink the prBOOM.wad and store every orignal id game in it's own subfolder

Attention this method was only tested for libretro-prboom in RetroPie branch

## How to setup
Please edit the script and use correct pathes and wadfiles.
Take care that you are using __prBOOM__!
Path variable does __not end with a /__
```bash
# Synopsis - Douple Check pathes and settings

# path variable should not end with slash!
# doom1.wad     loads all versions of DOOM and Final DOOM
# doom2.wad     loads all versions of DOOM II
# tnt.wad       loads extra TNT-Evilution  
# plutonia.wad  loads Mission Pack 2
#-------

path="/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/ports/doom"
wadfile="doom1.wad"
```

 | Launch Doom, Doom2, Plutonia, TNT-Evilution and other WAD files      rel. 07/15/17 |
 | Prerequisites:                                                                     |
 | 1. PrBOOM working on your Pie                                                      |
 | 2. WAD files of doom, doom2, tnt...                                                |
 | 3. Working zip! If not type "sudo apt install zip"                                 |
 |                                                                                    |
 +------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 |                                                                                    |
 | Why:                                                                               |
 | I think it's better to have a collection of all doom files in one folder and you   |
 | don't not have to mess around with symlinking and copy of prboom.wad.              |
 | So this will automate save game working in the same destination folder via zipping |
 |                                                                                    |
 | How to:                                                                            |
 | In your base folder ~/RetroPie/roms/doom/ copy all your WAD files you want to run  |
 |                                                                                    |
 | Check settings in Synopsis!                                                        |
 | Check if path locations is correct                                                 |
 | Check if wadfile settings load correct edition!                                    |
 | Save variable is autogenerated by wadfilename, you can change if you don't like    |
 |                                                                                    |
