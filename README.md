# launch-doom-packs-RP

Some scripts to easy launch several WADs used by prBOOM within RetroPie
It is intended to backup your savegames by zipping those and create one archive for each doom-branch you play.
So you don't need to symlink the prBOOM.wad and store every orignal id game in it's own subfolder

Attention this method was only tested for libretro-prboom in RetroPie branch
